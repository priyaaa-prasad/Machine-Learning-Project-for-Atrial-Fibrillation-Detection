# Machine-Learning-Project-for-Atrial-Fibrillation-Detection
# Action: Orchestrated a sophisticated deep learning model (e.g., CNN, RNN) to classify multifaceted ECG signals into four distinct categories, including atrial fibrillation.
# Problem: Redefining classification of ECG signals beyond conventional "normal" or "afib" categories to accommodate diverse signal complexities.
# Solution: Innovated a TensorFlow-based multi-class classifier, achieving an exceptional accuracy increase for each category by X% and an overall accuracy of Y%.
# Result: Crafted a groundbreaking model poised for integration into wearable devices or clinical decision support systems. The potential impact spans personalized healthcare interventions to real-time cardiac arrhythmia detection.
